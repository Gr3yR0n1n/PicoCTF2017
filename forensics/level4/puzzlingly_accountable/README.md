# Puzzlingly Accountable

I found the GETS that go to /secret/xxxxxxxxx in wireshark, yielding two results.  For each of these I followed the TCP Stream, and saved the data as raw, then deleted everything up until the PNG header in a hex editor, saved as a PNG, and opened.  I then proceeded to make a Piazza post because I couldn't tell the difference between the 1s and 7s in the final image.
